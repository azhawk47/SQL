In this example I imported the database Chinook.db into SQLite and then answered the following questions by creating the following queries.

1. Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US. (Hint: != or <> can be used to say "is not equal to").

SELECT FirstName, LastName, CustomerID, Country
    FROM Chinook.customers
    WHERE Country <> 'USA'

2. Show only the Customers from Brazil.

SELECT FirstName, LastName, CustomerID, Country
    FROM Chinook.customers
    WHERE Country = 'Brazil'

3. Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.

SELECT c.FirstName, c.LastName, i.InvoiceID, i.InvoiceDate, i.BillingCountry
    FROM Chinook.customers c
    LEFT JOIN Chinook.invoices i
    ON c.CustomerId = i. CustomerId
    WHERE Country = 'Brazil'

4. Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.

SELECT *
    FROM Chinook.employees
    WHERE Title = 'Sales Support Agent';

5. Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.

SELECT DISTINCT BillingCountry
    FROM Chinook.invoices

6. Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.

SELECT i.InvoiceId, e.FirstName, e.LastName
    FROM Chinook.customers c
    LEFT JOIN Chinook.employees e
    ON c.SupportRepId = e.EmployeeId
    LEFT JOIN Chinook.invoices i
    ON c.CustomerId = i.CustomerId
    ORDER BY i.InvoiceId

7. Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.

SELECT i.InvoiceId, i.Total, c.FirstName AS "Customer First Name", c.LastName AS "Customer Last Name", c.Country, e.FirstName AS "Sales Rep First Name", e.LastName AS "Sales Rep Last Name"
    FROM Chinook.customers AS c
    JOIN Chinook.employees AS e
    ON c.SupportRepId = e.EmployeeId
    JOIN Chinook.invoices AS i
    ON c.CustomerId = i.CustomerId
    ORDER BY i.InvoiceId;

8. How many Invoices were there in 2009?

SELECT COUNT(InvoiceId) AS Total_Invoices
    FROM Chinook.invoices
    WHERE InvoiceDate LIKE '2009%'

9. What are the total sales for 2009?

SELECT SUM(Total) AS Total_Sales
    FROM Chinook.invoices
    WHERE InvoiceDate LIKE '2009%'

10. Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line item.

SELECT c.FirstName, c.LastName, ii.InvoiceLineId, t.Name
    FROM Chinook.invoices i
    JOIN Chinook.invoice_items ii
    ON i.InvoiceId = ii.InvoiceId
    JOIN Chinook.tracks t
    ON ii.TrackId = t.TrackId
    JOIN Chinook.customers c
    ON i.CustomerId = c.CustomerId;

11. Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line item.

SELECT i.InvoiceId, ii.InvoiceLineId, t.Name, ar.Name
    FROM Chinook.invoices i
    JOIN Chinook.invoice_items ii
    ON i.InvoiceId = ii.InvoiceId
    JOIN Chinook.tracks t
    ON ii.TrackId = t.TrackId
    JOIN Chinook.customers c
    ON i.CustomerId = c.CustomerId
    JOIN Chinook.albums al
    ON t.AlbumId = al.AlbumId
    JOIN Chinook.artists ar
    ON al.ArtistId = ar.ArtistId;

12. Provide a query that shows all the Tracks, and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre.

SELECT t.Name AS SONG, a.Title AS ALBUM, mt.Name AS TYPE, g.Name AS GENRE 
    FROM Chinook.tracks t
    JOIN Chinook.media_types mt
    ON t.MediaTypeId = mt.MediaTypeId
    JOIN Chinook.genres g
    ON t.GenreId = g.GenreId
    JOIN Chinook.albums a
    ON t.AlbumId = a.AlbumId

13. Show the total sales made by each sales agent.

SELECT e.FirstName, e.LastName, ROUND(SUM(i.Total), 2) AS 'Total Sales'
    FROM Chinook.employees e
    JOIN Chinook.customers c
    ON e.EmployeeId = c.SupportRepId
    JOIN Chinook.invoices i
    ON c.CustomerId = i.CustomerId
    WHERE e.Title = 'Sales Support Agent'
    GROUP BY e.FirstName

14. Which sales agent made the most in sales in 2009?

SELECT e.FirstName, e.LastName, ROUND(SUM(i.Total), 2) AS 'Total Sales'
    FROM Chinook.employees e
    JOIN Chinook.customers c
    ON e.EmployeeId = c.SupportRepId
    JOIN Chinook.invoices i
    ON c.CustomerId = i.CustomerId
    WHERE e.Title = 'Sales Support Agent'
    AND i.InvoiceDate LIKE '2009%'
    GROUP BY e.FirstName
    ORDER BY 'Total Sales' DESC;
