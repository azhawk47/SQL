#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#1. How many orders were placed in January? 

SELECT COUNT(orderID) 
    FROM BIT_DB.JanSales;

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 

SELECT COUNT(orderID) 
    FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
    WHERE Product = 'iPhone'

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 

SELECT acctnum 
    FROM BIT_DB.FebSales sales
    JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
    ON cust.order_id = sales.orderID;

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 

SELECT distinct Product, price
    FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
    ORDER BY price
    LIMIT 5;

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?

SELECT DISTINCT Product, price
    FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
    WHERE price = (SELECT MIN(price) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales);
    
#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

SELECT Product, Quantity, Sum(Quantity)*price as Total_Revenue
    FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
    WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 

SELECT Count (cust.acctnum) as Customers, AVG(Quantity)*price as Average_Amount_Spent
    FROM BIT_DB.FebSales sales
    LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
    ON sales.orderID = cust.order_id
    WHERE Quantity>2;
